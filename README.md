I'm Dawid, a third-year student at the [WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/), who's been programming for some time now. I started my programming adventure a few years ago, falling in love with Python. Since then, I have developed my skills as software engineer in various technologies and gained two years of commercial experience. Briefly speaking, I am open-minded person who is not afraidto take on new challenges and is focused on gaining new knowledge every day.
