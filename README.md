I'm Dawid, a master's student at the [WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/) with a strong passion for programming. I started my programming journey a few years ago with Python, which sparked my enthusiasm for software development. Since then, I've advanced my skills as a software engineer across multiple technlogies, accumulating three years of professional experience. In addition to Python, I enjoy programming in Go during my free time, which I confidently regard as my second language. As an open-minded and driven individual, I embrace new challenges and am committed to continuously expanding my technical expertise.
